"# Airflow2_Basic" 

This project demonstrates practical usage of Apache Airflow to orchestrate and automate data workflows. The repository includes multiple DAG examples, covering different operators, scheduling strategies, and dependency management:

- Python and Bash Operators: Executing Python scripts and shell commands within Airflow tasks.

- Postgres Integration: Performing database operations using the Postgres operator.

- Task Dependencies: Demonstrating complex task flows and inter-task dependencies.

- Scheduling & Cron Expressions: Custom DAG scheduling, including cron-based schedules.

- Backfilling & Catchup: Managing historical runs and missed tasks.

- TaskFlow API Usage: Leveraging Airflowâ€™s modern TaskFlow API for cleaner DAG definitions.

This project is ideal for learning Airflow fundamentals, task orchestration patterns, and practical ETL workflow automation.
